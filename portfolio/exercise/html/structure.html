<b>c. What is a doctype and why is it important to include it in every HTML document?</b><br>
The doctype declaration should be the very first thing in an HTML document, before the tag. The doctype declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of the markup language the page is written in. The doctype declaration refers to a Document Type Definition (DTD).<br><br>

<b>d. What language can be used to style web documents?</b><br>

<b>f. What is a self closing HTML element? Give an example? </b><br>
HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.  is an empty element without a closing tag (the <br>tag defines a line break). Adding a slash inside the start tag, like <br/> , is the proper way of closing empty elements in XHTML and XML.<br><br>

<b>g. What is XML and why is it important to web developers? </b><br>
Extensible markup Language or XML plays a significant role in the present world of web development, it is perfectly useful for those who wish to make use of web technologies for, content is important not how it is presented. XML's motto is to elaborate the meaning of the content and not the presentation of the same.<br><br>

<b>h. Describe 4 XML rules?</b><br>
HTML is a forgiving language. It tolerates a host of sins, from imprecise markup to altogether missing elements, and can still generate a web page in the browser. XML, on the other hand, is basically a tyrant. Violate even the most trivial rule, and the browser or your application will crash. Some people find comfort in the uncompromising nature of XML, because it won't work unless you build it correctly. It's great to get instant feedback when you do something wrong! 

There are nine basic rules for building good XML: 
All XML must have a root element.
All tags must be closed.
All tags must be properly nested.
Tag names have strict limits.
Tag names are case sensitive.
Tag names cannot contain spaces.
Attribute values must appear within quotes ("").
White space is preserved.
HTML tags should be avoided (optional).
XML that follows these rules is said to be "well formed." But don't confuse well-formed XML with valid XML!<br><br>

<b>i. What is the difference between a "well-formed" and a valid web document?</b><br>
Documents that follow the XML syntax are referred as “well formed” and well formed document and conformance of a doctype is called valid web document.<br><br>
